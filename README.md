## Zubayda Hagi

I’ve transitioned from the structured world of education as a chemistry teacher to the dynamic realm of software development; my journey is marked by a consistent drive to understand and solve complex challenges. As a graduate of Makers Academy, I combine clear communication and collaborative spirit with technical proficiency in DevOps and cloud engineering. In my teaching career, I significantly boosted student success rates and led team-driven initiatives, transforming these mentoring and leadership qualities into valuable assets for the tech industry. With a foundation in Biochemistry and Genetics, my analytical mindset is well-suited for devising innovative solutions. I thrive on teamwork, adaptability, and the joy of demystifying the complex, striving to leave a meaningful impact in every project I undertake.

## Work Experience


**Makers Academy** (July 2023 to October 2023)  

Software and Cloud Engineering Bootcamp

- Developed robust software solutions by embracing Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles, utilising tools like Pytest for Python and applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) methodologies to enhance code quality and maintainability.

- Improved team dynamics and problem-solving capabilities through pair programming and group projects, adhering to Agile methodologies to meet critical deadlines and deliver value iteratively.

- Elevated team communication and empathy by conducting Emotional Intelligence (EQ) workshops, leading to more cohesive and effective collaboration.

- Integrated a suite of DevOps practices including containerisation with Docker and Kubernetes, infrastructure automation with Terraform, and continuous integration and deployment pipelines using Jenkins, resulting in streamlined deployments and scalable cloud infrastructure.

- Prioritised security and reliability by employing both Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) and Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools to proactively identify and address vulnerabilities, alongside leveraging AWS CloudWatch and Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) for real-time monitoring and site reliability management.

- Advanced software delivery processes by fostering a feedback-rich environment through rigorous code reviews, thereby enhancing collective codebase integrity and team skill levels.

## Skills

Your previous experience is really important. You will need to make it really clear to someone who has not worked in your field before exactly how your experience will be useful in software development.

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider projects you've worked on before Makers that you feel proud of and/or you think are relevent to technology. Good examples clearly explain the impact you've had. 


Here's an example

#### Communication
I honed my communication skills while completing my thesis at university, which involved writing and defending a dissertation to a board of professors and Ph.D. candidates. I further developed these skills when I was working in a digital marketing agency where I presented quarterly business reviews to C-level stakeholders. In doing so, I synthesised complex technical information into a digestible but comprehensive story for the different levels of knowledge in the room. My communication skills have also often come in handy while training to be a developer. For example, I recently ran a session for my mentees, who have only been coding for a few weeks, on how to use mocks to improve unit test isolation. I received feedback that the session was well run and helped them understand this potentially confusing topic.

#### Another skill

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

#### Another skill


## Education

#### Makers Academy (start_date to end_date)
- Use short descriptions of what you did and a skill you used. (Similar to format from the 'Work Experience' section above)
- e.g Frequently used paring in order to problemsolve effeciently, requiring teamwork and communication.
- you might also mention aspects some other skills/knowledge listed below: 
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine

#### Your University / College (start_date to end_date)

- Subject, any specialisms
- Grade
- Other cool stuff

#### Any other qualifications

That in some arguable way make you a better software developer or well-rounded person

## Hobbies

Any cool stuff that makes you a super part of a software development team
